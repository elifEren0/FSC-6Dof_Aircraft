# Flight Stability and Control Project

In this project, the dynamics of the 6-degree-of-freedom aircraft are modeled. Aerodynamic and Thrust data is available in the F16_LookupTables.mat file. Using the given data, nonlinear 6-DoF flight dynamics are simulated using MATLAB. Velocity Hold, Pitch-Attitude Hold, Altitude-Hold and Roll-Angle Hold Autopilot are designed. Then the controllers are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink.
